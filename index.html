  <h1>Ethical Hacking </h1>
<body> Welcome junior hackers, today I will be taking us on a road trip to being Ethical Hackers. <br>We will be learning the meaning and tutorial on how to use some basic tools and the BEST OS to use, cheap right. Have in mind this is for educational purposes only, do not violate any of the knowledge here else ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘®ðŸ‘® will get you.
</body>
<h2>What is Ethical Hacking?</h2>
<body> Before we begin now, what is hacking? <br><b>Hacking </b> is the act of having illegal access to people's device and steal their info.<br> In hacking, there are three types:<ul>1.White Hat<br>2. Black Hat<br>3.Grey Hat.</ul><br> The white hat hackers are ethical hackers. <b>Ethical Hacking</b> is the act of gaining access to ones device with permission which is legal. The black hat is the opposite while the grey hat is the combination of both. They gain legal access a nd they create  a ransomware which is a typeof malware that locks your apps and needs money before any of your apps can work. 
</body>
  <h1>Ethical Hacking Tools</h1>
<body> We use Termux which is a terminal emulator used for hacking. 
  The basic tools we will look into first is nmap.<br><b><p>What is Nmap?</b></p><br>Nmap means Network Mapping. It is a tool used for scanning vulnerability in a device to find open ports before injecting payload.It is 
  also used to scan vulnerability in a website. For example, to install and use in Kali Linux or any other O.S;<br><ol><textarea> sudo apt install nmap</textarea></ol><br><ol><textarea>nmap -n 192.5.0.0.43</textarea></ol><br>You can also hide during scanning by replacing<b> -n</b> with<b> -sS</b> which means stealth scan.
  </body>
  <h2>2. Metasploit-Framework</h2>
  <body> Metasploit-Framework is a post-exploitation tool used to exploit known bugs. Let's break it down, it is used to gain access and control over a device. It can also be used to dump call logs,sms,open url,get ip address and many more. To install in your O.S, use the same command used for nmap but replace nmap with metasploit-framework.<br><p><b>How does it work?</b></p><p><br>It uses <u>msfvenom</u> to create payload for Android in apk format and for windows in exe format and uses <u>msfconsole</u> to setup listener and wait for connection.  he payload is sent, installed and run in the vic.   device. Then the msfconsole  c llects all the information from th device using meterpreter or smb shell. For example;<ol><br> msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -o backdoor.apk</ol></p><p><ol><textarea>msfconsole</textarea> </ol></p>. The msfconsole lets you to setup a listener and wait for connection. You can use the --help command in msf6 to learn how to use it.
</body>
<h2>3. Sqlmap </h2>
<body> Sqlmap is a tool used inject virus or any other malware into a website or a device. It doesn't have much feature or uses but comes in handy when needed to inject a virus.<br> These are the basic tools, but there are varieties and wide range of tools available. Work on them and you will be perfect.</body>
<h2>4. O.S(Operating system)</h2>
<body> The term "O.S" refers to the terminal emulator used for ethical hacking practice. There are of different types and they have different characteristics.</body>
<h3>1. Kali Linux </h3>
<body> Kali Linux is the world's most used O.S terminal. It comes with pre-installed tools including the one listed above. It can be used as a <b> GUI(Graphical User Interface)</b> through Virtual Box or as a <b>CLI(Command Line Interface)</b> through<i> Termux</i>. A lot of people enjoy it while further study states that it is not safe because you can't stay hidden during hacking. Further study also states that thre are few tools like docker which helps to stay hidden.</body>
<h3>2.Parrot O.S</h3>
<body> This O.S is based on security purposes. It has the same characteristics as Kali but it is safer than Kali. <br><p> It has all the tools as Kali but has other tools that enhances efficiency and easy usage.</p> We have many other O.S to explore but these are the main and best to use.</body>
